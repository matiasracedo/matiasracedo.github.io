# About

<h5>I studied Full Stack Web Development at Henry, an online intensive course with +700 hours of programming based on practice and real projects. I'm passionate about new technologies and software development, I'm a quick learner and I love challenges!</h5> 

The technologies I feel more confortable working with are: HTML/CSS (Sass), Javascript, Node.Js/Express, Reactjs, Redux, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, Passport and Firebase. I've recently started developing mobile apps with React Native, TypeScript, MongoDB and Mongoose. I also have some experience using libraries like Bootstrap, Material UI and rsuite, and I'm familiar with Agile Methodologies like Scrum.
