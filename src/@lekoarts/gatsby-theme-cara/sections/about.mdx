## About me

I studied Full Stack Web Development at Henry, an online intensive course with +700 hours of programming based on practice and real projects. I'm passionate about new technologies and software development, I'm a quick learner and I love challenges! 

The technologies I've worked with: HTML/CSS (Sass), Javascript, NodeJS/ExpressJS, ReactJS, Redux, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, Passport and Firebase. I've also recently started developing mobile apps using TypeScript with React Native, MongoDB and Mongoose. I have experience using libraries like Bootstrap, Material UI and rsuite, and I'm familiar with Agile Methodologies (Scrum).
